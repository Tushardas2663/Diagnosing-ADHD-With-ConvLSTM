The burning embers do not die but change their form from matter to energy to warm your heart and hearth. Matter and energy are one and they are constant in the universe like your Lord.\n",

              "\"The air is thick, so thick it seems to burn. The sun, a molten ember in a sky of ash, tries in vain to pierce the shroud. The rivers, veins of Mother Earth, are drying up, only to be replaced by salt tears of distress. The oceans churn and thunder, unable to contain their rage. \\n\\nI have seen it all. I have smelled the sulfurous breath of Satan who has caused this. He has set afire the greed in man's heart. Man, the crown of creation, forgets that he is but a tenant, not the owner. Yet, he tries to engulf the Earth in his gluttonous fires. He forgets that the Earth can extinguish the fires of greed with her tears of rage. \\n\\nIt's time to act, lest the Earth get ireful. The skies may open up to unleash her tears of thunderstorms. The oceans may rise up to engulf the land. The زمین (Zameen, land) may tremble beneath your feet. Do not mistake the Earth's kindness for weakness. She has silently suffered for millennia. Now she is about to unleash her rage. \\nIt's time to quench the fires of greed in your heart before they burn your soul. Open your eyes and see the plight of the Earth. Open your ears and listen to her cries for help. Open your heart and gain her blessings.\\n\""
